--
-- Note that if any of these pre-placed structures overlap, we can't be sure of
-- the author's intent as to which member of the overlap should take precedence,
-- so perhaps it would be ideal to throw an error at scenario parse time.
--
-- However, determining whether a structure is all three of:
-- 1. placed
-- 2. still recognizable
-- 3. overlapping with another recognized structure
-- occurs at a later phase than scenario parse; it requires access to the 'GameState'.
--
-- So we just use the same sorting criteria as the one used to resolve recognition
-- conflicts at entity placement time (see [STRUCTURE RECOGNIZER CONFLICT RESOLUTION]).
