-- = Waypoint ordering
--
-- The sequence of waypoints of a given name is dictated by criteria in the following order:
--
-- 1. Ordering of structure placements
--    (see implementation of 'Swarm.Game.Scenario.Topography.Structure.assembleStructure');
--    later placements are ordered later.
-- 2. Placement of cells within a map. Map locations go by row-major order
--    (compare to docs for 'Swarm.Game.State.genRobotTemplates').
--
-- TODO (#1366): May be useful to have a mechanism for more
-- precise control of ordering.
