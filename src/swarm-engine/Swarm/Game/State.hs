-- The main GameState record type
------------------------------------------------------------

-- | The main record holding the state for the game itself (as
--   distinct from the UI).  See the lenses below for access to its
--   fields.
--
--   To answer the question of what belongs in the `GameState` and
--   what belongs in the `UIState`, ask yourself the question: is this
--   something specific to a particular UI, or is it something
--   inherent to the game which would be needed even if we put a
--   different UI on top (web-based, GUI-based, etc.)? For example,
--   tracking whether the game is paused needs to be in the
--   `GameState`: especially if we want to have the game running in
--   one thread and the UI running in another thread, then the game
--   itself needs to keep track of whether it is currently paused, so
--   that it can know whether to step independently of the UI telling
--   it so. For example, the game may run for several ticks during a
--   single frame, but if an objective is completed during one of
--   those ticks, the game needs to immediately auto-pause without
--   waiting for the UI to tell it that it should do so, which could
--   come several ticks late.
