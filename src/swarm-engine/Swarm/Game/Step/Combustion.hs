-- | A system program for a "combustion robot", to burn an entity
--   after it is ignited.
--
-- For efficiency, we determine a priori (i.e. the instant
-- the combustion robot is spawned) whether any neighbors will eventually
-- be burned, based on probabilities.
--
-- Note that it is possible that new neighbors may be introduced while
-- combustion is in progress. Although it may be more realistic to subject
-- these to possible combustion as well, we do not bother.
--
-- Though if we did actually want to do that, some options are:
--
-- 1. Create sub-partitions (of say, 10-tick duration) of the combustion duration
--    to re-evaluate opportunities to light adjacent entities on fire.
-- 2. Use the 'Swarm.Language.Syntax.Watch' command to observe for changes to adjacent entities.
--    Note that if we "wake" from our 'Swarm.Language.Syntax.Wait' due to the 'Swarm.Language.Syntax.Watch' being triggered,
--    we would need to maintain bookkeeping of how much time is left.
-- 3. Spawn more robots whose sole purpose is to observe for changes to neighbor
--    cells. This would avoid polluting the logic of the currently burning cell
--    with logic to manage probabilities of combustion propagation.
