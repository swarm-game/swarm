-- Description: State machine of Swarm's interpreter
--
-- The Swarm interpreter uses a technique known as a
-- <https://matt.might.net/articles/cesk-machines/ CESK machine> (if
-- you want to read up on them, you may want to start by reading about
-- <https://matt.might.net/articles/cek-machines/ CEK machines>
-- first).  Execution happens simply by iterating a step function,
-- sending one state of the CESK machine to the next. In addition to
-- being relatively efficient, this means we can easily run a bunch of
-- robots synchronously, in parallel, without resorting to any threads
-- (by stepping their machines in a round-robin fashion); pause and
-- single-step the game; save and resume, and so on.
--
-- Essentially, a CESK machine state has four components:
--
-- - The __C__ontrol is the thing we are currently focused on:
--   either a 'Term' to evaluate, or a 'Value' that we have
--   just finished evaluating.
-- - The __E__nvironment ('Env') is a mapping from variables that might
--   occur free in the Control to their values.
-- - The __S__tore ('Store') is a mapping from abstract integer
--   /locations/ to values.  We use it to store delayed (lazy) values,
--   so they will be computed at most once.
-- - The __K__ontinuation ('Cont') is a stack of 'Frame's,
--   representing the evaluation context, /i.e./ what we are supposed
--   to do after we finish with the currently focused thing.  When we
--   reduce the currently focused term to a value, the top frame on
--   the stack tells us how to proceed.
--
-- You can think of a CESK machine as a defunctionalization of a
-- recursive big-step interpreter, where we explicitly keep track of
-- the call stack and the environments that would be in effect at
-- various places in the recursion.  One could probably even derive
-- this mechanically, by writing a recursive big-step interpreter,
-- then converting it to CPS, then defunctionalizing the
-- continuations.
--
-- The slightly confusing thing about CESK machines is how we
-- have to pass around environments everywhere.  Basically,
-- anywhere there can be unevaluated terms containing free
-- variables (in values, in continuation stack frames, ...), we
-- have to store the proper environment alongside so that when
-- we eventually get around to evaluating it, we will be able to
-- pull out the environment to use.

-- Frames and continuations
------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A frame is a single component of a continuation stack, explaining
--   what to do next after we finish evaluating the currently focused
--   term.
data Frame
  = -- | We were evaluating the first component of a pair; next, we
    --   should evaluate the second component which was saved in this
    --   frame (and push a 'FFst' frame on the stack to save the first component).
    FSnd Term Env
  | -- | We were evaluating the second component of a pair; when done,
    --   we should combine it with the value of the first component saved
    --   in this frame to construct a fully evaluated pair.
    FFst Value
  | -- | @FArg t e@ says that we were evaluating the left-hand side of
    -- an application, so the next thing we should do is evaluate the
    -- term @t@ (the right-hand side, /i.e./ argument of the
    -- application) in environment @e@.  We will also push an 'FApp'
    -- frame on the stack.
    FArg Term Env
  | -- | @FApp v@ says that we were evaluating the right-hand side of
    -- an application; once we are done, we should pass the resulting
    -- value as an argument to @v@.
    FApp Value
  | -- | @FLet x ty t2 e@ says that we were evaluating a term @t1@ of
    -- type @ty@ in an expression of the form @let x = t1 in t2@, that
    -- is, we were evaluating the definition of @x@; the next thing we
    -- should do is evaluate @t2@ in the environment @e@ extended with
    -- a binding for @x@.
    FLet Var (Maybe (Polytype, Requirements)) Term Env
  | -- | We are executing inside a 'Try' block.  If an exception is
    --   raised, we will execute the stored term (the "catch" block).
    FTry Value
  | -- | An @FExec@ frame means the focused value is a command, which
    -- we should now execute.
    FExec
  | -- | We are in the process of executing the first component of a
    --   bind; once done, we should also execute the second component
    --   in the given environment (extended by binding the variable,
    --   if there is one, to the output of the first command).
    FBind (Maybe Var) (Maybe (Polytype, Requirements)) Term Env

-- CESK machine

-- | The overall state of a CESK machine, which can actually be one of

--   kind of state, and it would probably be possible to inline a
--   bunch of things and get rid of the second state, but I find it
--   much more natural and elegant this way.  Most tutorial
--   presentations of CEK/CESK machines only have one kind of state, but
--   then again, most tutorial presentations only deal with the bare
--   lambda calculus, so one can tell whether a term is a value just
--   by seeing whether it is syntactically a lambda.  I learned this
--   approach from Harper's Practical Foundations of Programming
--   Languages.
data CESK
  = -- | When we are on our way "in/down" into a term, we have a
    --   currently focused term to evaluate in the environment, a store,
    --   and a continuation.  In this mode we generally pattern-match on the
    --   'Term' to decide what to do next.
    In Term Env Store Cont
  | -- | Once we finish evaluating a term, we end up with a 'Value'
    --   and we switch into "out" mode, bringing the value back up
    --   out of the depths to the context that was expecting it.  In
    --   this mode we generally pattern-match on the 'Cont' to decide
    --   what to do next.
    --
    --   Note that there is no 'Env', because we don't have anything
    --   with variables to evaluate at the moment, and we maintain the
    --   invariant that any unevaluated terms buried inside a 'Value'
    --   or 'Cont' must carry along their environment with them.
    Out Value Store Cont
  | -- | An exception has been raised.  Keep unwinding the
    --   continuation stack (until finding an enclosing 'Try' in the
    --   case of a command failure or a user-generated exception, or
    --   until the stack is empty in the case of a fatal exception).
    Up Exn Store Cont
  | -- | The machine is waiting for the game to reach a certain time
    --   to resume its execution.
    Waiting TickNumber CESK
  | -- | The machine is suspended, i.e. waiting for another term to
    --   evaluate.  This happens after we have evaluated whatever the
    --   user entered at the REPL and we are waiting for them to type
    --   something else.  Conceptually, this is like a combination of
    --   'Out' and 'In': we store a 'Value' that was just yielded by
    --   evaluation, and otherwise it is just like 'In' with a hole
    --   for the 'Term' we are going to evaluate.
