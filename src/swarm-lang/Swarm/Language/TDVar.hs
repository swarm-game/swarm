-- ~~~~ Note [Shadowing for value-level and type-level variables]
--
-- The problem we are solving here is: what happens when y is defined
-- in terms of x, but then later x is redefined/shadowed?  We want to
-- make sure that y still refers to the *old*, shadowed version of x,
-- not the new one.  This problem with user-defined type names caused
-- a type soundness bug, https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/2437 .
--
-- So how do the version numbers help solve this... and why wasn't it
-- already a problem with value-level names (i.e. things defined via
-- `def`)?
--
-- The language is strict at the value level.  Any use of a variable
-- will be immediately evaluated.  The resulting value will either not
-- mention variables any more, OR will be some kind of closure that
-- contains an environment mapping in-scope variables to their values.
-- So if y is defined in terms of x, it will be evaluated and either
-- not refer to x any more (e.g. `def y = x + 2 end`) or contain a
-- closure with the current value of x.  So if x is later shadowed it
-- makes no difference to the value of y.
--
-- On the other hand, user-defined types are evaluated lazily.  This
-- is a feature: otherwise it would be very annoying to use them for
-- purposes of abbreviating long types (see the discussion at
-- https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/2438).
--
-- One way this could be solved is by making each type a closure that
-- stores a TDCtx along with it.  However, that would be pretty
-- annoying and require large and tedious changes to the codebase.
-- The other solution is to use version numbers: when a user type is
-- defined, it is given a version number which is one greater than the
-- latest version of the same name already in the TDCtx.  Other
-- definitions referring to older versions will continue to refer to
-- them, and the definitions of the older versions will be
-- retained. When a user type name is used, it is parsed initially as
-- version 0, but in a later name resolution phase (see
-- 'Swarm.Language.Kindcheck.resolveTydefs') the version is updated to
-- the latest in-scope version.

-- | Pretty-print a type definition variable, given an extra argument

--   it is not the latest version, print @name%version@.

-- TODO(#2452): overhaul pretty-printing to take extra
-- environment/parameters, such as TDCtx to know when to print a user
-- type name with its version number, to disambiguate when it has been
-- shadowed.

-- | The 'PrettyPrec' instance for 'TDVar' never prints the version
--   number.  If you care about the version number possibly being
--   printed, you must use 'prettyTDVar' instead.
