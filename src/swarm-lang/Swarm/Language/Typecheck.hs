-- | Infer the type of a term, returning a type-annotated term.
--
--   The only cases explicitly handled in 'infer' are those where
--   pushing an expected type down into the term can't possibly help,
--   e.g. most primitives, function application, and binds.
--
--   For most everything else we prefer 'check' because it can often
--   result in better and more localized type error messages.
--
--   Note that we choose to do kind checking inline as we go during
--   typechecking.  This has pros and cons.  The benefit is that we get
--   to piggyback on the existing source location tracking and
--   typechecking stack, so we can generate better error messages.  The
--   downside is that we have to be really careful not to miss any types
--   along the way; there is no difference, at the Haskell type level,
--   between ill- and well-kinded Swarm types, so we just have to make
--   sure that we call checkKind on every type embedded in the term
--   being checked.

-- ~~~~ Note [Checking and inference for record literals]

-- We need to handle record literals in both inference and checking
-- mode.  By way of contrast, with a pair, if we are in checking
-- mode and the expected type is not manifestly a product type, we
-- can just generate fresh unification variables for the types of
-- the two components, generate a constraint that the expected type
-- is equal to a product type of these two fresh types, and continue
-- in checking mode on both sides.  With records, however, we cannot
-- do that; if we are checking a record and the expected type is not
-- manifestly a record type, we must simply switch into inference
-- mode.  However, it is still helpful to be able to handle records
-- in checking mode too, since if we know a record type it is
-- helpful to be able to push the field types down into the fields.

------------------------------------------------------------
-- Special atomic checking

-- | Ensure a term is a valid argument to @atomic@.  Valid arguments
--   may not contain @def@, @let@, or lambda. Any variables which are
--   referenced must have a primitive, first-order type such as
--   @Text@ or @Int@ (in particular, no functions, @Cmd@, or
--   @delay@).  We simply assume that any locally bound variables are
--   OK without checking their type: the only way to bind a variable
--   locally is with a binder of the form @x <- c1; c2@, where @c1@ is
--   some primitive command (since we can't refer to external
--   variables of type @Cmd a@).  If we wanted to do something more
--   sophisticated with locally bound variables we would have to
--   inline this analysis into typechecking proper, instead of having
--   it be a separate, out-of-band check.
--
--   The goal is to ensure that any argument to @atomic@ is guaranteed
--   to evaluate and execute in some small, finite amount of time, so
--   that it's impossible to write a term which runs atomically for an
--   indefinite amount of time and freezes the rest of the game.  Of
--   course, nothing prevents one from writing a large amount of code
--   inside an @atomic@ block; but we want the execution time to be
--   linear in the size of the code.
--
--   We also ensure that the atomic block takes at most one tick,
--   i.e. contains at most one tangible command. For example, @atomic
--   (move; move)@ is invalid, since that would allow robots to move
--   twice as fast as usual by doing both actions in one tick.
