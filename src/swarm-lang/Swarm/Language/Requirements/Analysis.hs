-- | Infer the requirements to execute/evaluate a term in a given
--   context.
--
--   For function application and let-expressions, we assume that the
--   argument (respectively let-bound expression) is used at least
--   once in the body.  Doing otherwise would require a much more
--   fine-grained analysis where we differentiate between the
--   capabilities needed to *evaluate* versus *execute* any expression
--   (since e.g. an unused let-binding would still incur the
--   capabilities to *evaluate* it), which does not seem worth it at
--   all.
--
--   This is all a bit of a hack at the moment, to be honest; see #231
--   for a description of a more correct approach.
