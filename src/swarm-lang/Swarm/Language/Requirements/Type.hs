-- | A /requirement/ is something a robot must have when it is
--   built. There are three types:
--   - A robot can require a certain 'Capability', which should be fulfilled
--     by equipping an appropriate device.
--   - A robot can require a specific /device/, which should be equipped.
--   - A robot can require some number of a specific entity in its inventory.
data Requirement
  = -- | Require a specific capability.  This must be fulfilled by
    --   equipping an appropriate device.  Requiring the same
    --   capability multiple times is the same as requiring it once.
    ReqCap Capability
  | -- | Require a specific device to be equipped.  Note that at this
    --   point it is only a name, and has not been resolved to an actual
    --   'Swarm.Game.Entity.Entity'.  That's because programs have to be type- and
    --   capability-checked independent of an 'Swarm.Game.Entity.EntityMap'.  The name
    --   will be looked up at runtime, when actually executing a 'Swarm.Language.Syntax.Build'
    --   or 'Swarm.Language.Syntax.Reprogram' command, and an appropriate exception thrown if
    --   a device with the given name does not exist.
    --
    --   Requiring the same device multiple times is the same as
    --   requiring it once.
    ReqDev Text
  | -- | Require a certain number of a specific entity to be available
    --   in the inventory.  The same comments apply re: resolving the
    --   entity name to an actual 'Swarm.Game.Entity.Entity'.
    --
    --   Inventory requirements are additive, that is, say, requiring 5
    --   of entity @"e"@ and later requiring 7 is the same as requiring
    --   12.

-- | It is tempting to define @Requirements = Set Requirement@, but

--   their counts added rather than simply being deduplicated.
--
--   Since we will eventually need to deal with the different types of
--   requirements separately, it makes sense to store them separately
--   anyway.
