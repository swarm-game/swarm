-- Constants
------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Constants, representing various built-in functions and commands.
--
--   IF YOU ADD A NEW CONSTANT, be sure to also update:
--   1. the 'constInfo' function (below)
--   2. the capability checker ("Swarm.Language.Capability")
--   3. the type checker ("Swarm.Language.Typecheck")
--   4. the runtime ("Swarm.Game.Step")
--   5. the emacs mode syntax highlighter (@contribs/swarm-mode.el@)
--
--   GHC will warn you about incomplete pattern matches for the first
--   four, and CI will warn you about the last, so in theory it's not
--   really possible to forget.  Note you do not need to update the
--   parser or pretty-printer, since they are auto-generated from
--   'constInfo'.
