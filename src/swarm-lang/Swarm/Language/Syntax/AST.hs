  | -- | A text literal.
    TText Text
  | -- | An antiquoted Haskell variable name of type Text.
    TAntiText Text
  | -- | A Boolean literal.
    TBool Bool
  | -- | A robot reference.  These never show up in surface syntax, but are
    --   here so we can factor pretty-printing for Values through
    --   pretty-printing for Terms.
    TRobot Int
  | -- | A memory reference.  These likewise never show up in surface syntax,
    --   but are here to facilitate pretty-printing.
    TRef Int
  | -- | Require a specific device to be installed.
    TRequireDevice Text
  | -- | Require a certain number of an entity.
    TRequire Int Text
  | -- | Primitive command to log requirements of a term.  The Text
    --   field is to store the unaltered original text of the term, for use
    --   in displaying the log message (since once we get to execution time the
    --   original term may have been elaborated, e.g. `force` may have been added
    --   around some variables, etc.)
    SRequirements Text (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | A variable.

  | -- | A pair.
    SPair (Syntax' ty) (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | A lambda expression, with or without a type annotation on the
    --   binder.
    SLam LocVar (Maybe Type) (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | Function application.
    SApp (Syntax' ty) (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | A (recursive) let/def expression, with or without a type
    --   annotation on the variable. The @Bool@ indicates whether
    --   it is known to be recursive.
    --
    --   The @Maybe Polytype@ and @Maybe Requirements@ fields are only
    --   for annotating the requirements of a definition after
    --   typechecking; there is no way to annotate requirements in the
    --   surface syntax.
    SLet LetSyntax Bool LocVar (Maybe RawPolytype) (Maybe Polytype) (Maybe Requirements) (Syntax' ty) (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | A type synonym definition.  Note that this acts like a @let@
    --   (just like @def@), /i.e./ the @Syntax' ty@ field is the local
    --   context over which the type definition is in scope.
    STydef LocVar Polytype (Maybe TydefInfo) (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | A monadic bind for commands, of the form @c1 ; c2@ or @x <- c1; c2@.
    --
    --   The @Maybe ty@ field is a place to stash the inferred type of
    --   the variable (if any) during type inference.  Once type
    --   inference is complete, during elaboration we will copy the
    --   inferred type into the @Maybe Polytype@ field (since the
    --   @Maybe ty@ field will be erased).
    --
    --   The @Maybe Polytype@ and @Maybe Requirements@ fields is only
    --   for annotating the type of a bind after typechecking; there
    --   is no surface syntax that allows directly annotating a bind
    --   with either one.

  | -- | Delay evaluation of a term, written @{...}@.  Swarm is an
    --   eager language, but in some cases (e.g. for @if@ statements
    --   and recursive bindings) we need to delay evaluation.  The
    --   counterpart to @{...}@ is @force@, where @force {t} = t@.
    --   Note that 'Force' is just a constant, whereas 'SDelay' has to
    --   be a special syntactic form so its argument can get special
    --   treatment during evaluation.
    SDelay (Syntax' ty)
  | -- | Record literals @[x1 = e1, x2 = e2, x3, ...]@ Names @x@
    --   without an accompanying definition are sugar for writing
    --   @x=x@.
