-- | Perform some elaboration / rewriting on a fully type-annotated
--   term.  This currently performs such operations as rewriting @if@
--   expressions and recursive let expressions to use laziness
--   appropriately.  It also inserts types and requirements on bound
--   variables so they will be available at runtime.
--
--   In theory it could also perform rewriting for overloaded
--   constants depending on the actual type they are used at, but
--   currently that sort of thing tends to make type inference fall
--   over.

  -- families must yield equal results on 'Typed' and 'Elaborated'; the
  -- distinction between 'Typed' and 'Elaborated' is ONLY to serve as a
  -- type-level flag that we have performed elaboration.
  --
  -- The reason we need unsafeCoerce is that all the generic rewriting
  -- utilities (such as 'transform') are necessarily type-preserving.
  -- We could write our own version of 'transform' that recurses
  -- through the entire 'Syntax', applying a type-changing 'rewrite'
  -- everywhere it is applicable and reconstructing the AST everywhere
  -- else in order to change the type.  But that would be a huge pain.

    -- we can keep track of the types of variables in scope, for use

    -- reason we do not do this for 'let' is so that 'let' introduces
    -- truly local bindings which will not be available for use in
    -- later REPL terms.

    -- filled in during typechecking.  The reason we need to wait
    -- until now to fill in the types is that we have to wait until
    -- solving, substitution, and generalization are complete.

    -- Eventually, once requirements analysis is part of typechecking,
    -- we'll infer them both at typechecking time then fill them in
    -- during elaboration here.
