-- | Perform some elaboration / rewriting on a fully type-annotated
--   term.  This currently performs such operations as rewriting @if@
--   expressions and recursive let expressions to use laziness
--   appropriately.  It also inserts types and requirements on bound
--   variables so they will be available at runtime.
--
--   In theory it could also perform rewriting for overloaded
--   constants depending on the actual type they are used at, but
--   currently that sort of thing tends to make type inference fall
--   over.
