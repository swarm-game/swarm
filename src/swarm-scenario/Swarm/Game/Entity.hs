-- Description: Object that exists in the world
--
-- An 'Entity' represents an object that exists in the world.  Each
-- entity has a way to be displayed, some metadata such as a name and
-- description, some properties, and possibly an inventory of other
-- entities.
--
-- This module also defines the 'Inventory' type, since the two types
-- are mutually recursive (an inventory contains entities, which can
-- have inventories).

-- Entity
------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A record to hold information about an entity.
--
--   The constructor for 'Entity' is intentionally not exported.  To
--   construct one manually, use the 'mkEntity' function.
--
--   There are two main constraints on the way entities are stored:
--
--   1. We want to be able to easily modify an entity in one
--      particular cell of the world (for example, painting one
--      tree red).
--   2. In an inventory, we want to store identical entities only
--      once, along with a count.
--
--   We could get (2) nicely by storing only names of entities, and
--   having a global lookup table from names to entity records.
--   However, storing names instead of actual entity records in the
--   world makes (1) more complex: every time we modify an entity we
--   would have to generate a fresh name for the modified entity and
--   add it to the global entity table.  This approach is also
--   annoying because it means we can't just uses lenses to drill down
--   into the properties of an entity in the world or in an inventory,
--   but have to do an intermediate lookup in the global (mutable!)
--   entity table.
--
--   On the other hand, if we just store entity records everywhere,
--   checking them for equality becomes expensive.  Having an
--   inventory be a map with entities themselves as keys sounds awful.
--
--   The solution we adopt here is that every @Entity@ record carries
--   along a hash value of all the other fields.  We just assume that
--   these hashes are unique (a collision is of course possible but
--   extremely unlikely).  Entities can be efficiently compared just
--   by looking at their hashes; they can be stored in a map using
--   hash values as keys; and we provide lenses which automatically
--   recompute the hash value when modifying a field of an entity
--   record.  Note also that world storage is still efficient, too:
--   thanks to referential transparency, in practice most of the
--   entities stored in the world that are the same will literally
--   just be stored as pointers to the same shared record.
data Entity = Entity
  { _entityHash :: Int
  -- ^ A hash value computed from the other fields
  , _entityDisplay :: Display
  -- ^ The way this entity should be displayed on the world map.
  , _entityName :: EntityName
  -- ^ The name of the entity, used /e.g./ in an inventory display.
  , _entityPlural :: Maybe Text
  -- ^ The plural of the entity name, in case it is irregular.  If
  --   this field is @Nothing@, default pluralization heuristics
  --   will be used (see 'plural').
  , _entityDescription :: Document Syntax
  -- ^ A longer-form description. Each 'Text' value is one
  --   paragraph.
  , _entityTags :: Set Text
  -- ^ A set of categories to which the entity belongs
  , _entityOrientation :: Maybe Heading
  -- ^ The entity's orientation (if it has one).  For example, when
  --   a robot moves, it moves in the direction of its orientation.

  -- ^ If this entity grows, how long does it take?

  , _entityInventory :: Inventory
