  description:
    - A fast grabber is an improved version of the basic grabber - not only can it `grab`, `place`, and `give`, it can also `swap`.
    - The `swap` command allows the robot to execute grab and place at the same time so that the location where the robot is standing does not become empty.
    - You can use this to prevent failures where multiple robots are trying to grab, place or scan a given location.
    - In addition you retain the capability to use the `atomic` command, with which you can implement other commands that are safe when run in parallel.

  description:
    - |
      A calculator with Advanced Display Technology (an attached
      typewriter that can print out the results).  For some reason, in
      addition to the usual arithmetic on numbers, an ADT calculator can
      also do arithmetic on types!  After all, the helpful typewritten manual
      explains, a type is just a collection of values, and a finite collection
      of values is just a fancy number.  For example, the type `Bool`{=type} is
      just a fancy version of the number 2, where the two things happen to be
      labelled `false` and `true`.  There are also types `Unit`{=type} and
      `Void`{=type} that correspond to 1 and 0, respectively.
    - |
      The product of two types is a type of pairs, since, for example,
      if `t`{=type} is a type with three elements, then there are 2 * 3 = 6
      different pairs containing a `Bool`{=type} and a `t`{=type}, that is, 6 elements
      of type `Bool * t`{=type}.  For working with products of types, the ADT
      calculator enables pair syntax `(1, "Hi!")` as well as the pair elimination
      function `match : a * b -> (a -> b -> c) -> c`.
    - |
      The sum of two types is a type with two options; for example, a
      value of type `Bool + t`{=type} is either a `Bool`{=type} value or a `t`{=type} value,
      and there are `2 + 3 == 5` such values.  For working with sums of
      types, the ADT calculator provides the injection functions `inl :
      a -> a + b` and `inr : b -> a + b`, as well as the case analysis
      function `case : (a + b) -> (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> c`.  For
      example, `case (inl 3) (\x. 2*x) (\y. 3*y) == 6`, and `case (inr
      3) (\x. 2*x) (\y. 3*y) == 9`.
