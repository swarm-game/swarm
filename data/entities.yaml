- name: grabber
  display:

    char: '<'
  description:
  - A grabber arm is an all-purpose device allowing a robot to
    manipulate other items and robots via the 'grab', 'place', 'give',
    and 'install' commands.
  - The 'grab' command takes no arguments; it simply grabs whatever is
    available, and also returns the name of the grabbed thing as a string.
    It raises an exception if run in a cell that does not contain an item.
  - The 'place' command takes one argument, the name of the item to
    place.  The item is removed from the robot's inventory and placed
    in the robot's current cell (which must be empty).  Raises an
    exception if the operation fails.
  - "The 'give' command takes two arguments: the name of the robot to
    give an item to (which can be at most 1 cell away), and the name
    of the item to give. Raises an exception if the operation fails."
  - "The 'install' command takes two arguments: the name of the robot
    on which to install a device (which can be at most 1 cell away),
    and the name of the device to install."

  capabilities: [grab, give, place, install]

  - "'salvage' takes no arguments. It looks for an inactive
    robot (one which is not currently running a program) in the
    current cell. If an inactive robot is found, its log (if any) is
    downloaded and it is dismantled, transferring its devices and inventory to the
    robot running 'salvage'.  If no inactive robots are found in the
    current cell, 'salvage' does nothing."

    builds a robot named "fred" to get the tree on the cell to the
    east (if there is one) and bring it back to you. Note that if
    there is already a robot named "fred", the new robot will be given
    a similar but unique name.  The 'build' command always returns the
    name of the newly constructed robot. For example,
  - '  name <- build "fred" {move}; view name'

    builds a robot and then views it (no matter what it ends up being named).

  description:

    A dictionary allows a robot to remember definitions and reuse them
    later.  You can access this ability with either a 'def' command,
    which creates a name for an expression or command that is
    available from then on, or with a 'let' expression, which names an
    expression or command locally within another expression.
  - '  def m2 : cmd () = move; move end'
  - '  let x : int = 3 in x^2 + 2*x + 1'

  - "A scanner also enables the 'blocked' command, which returns a
     boolean value indicating whether the robot's path is blocked
