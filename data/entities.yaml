    It raises an exception if run in a cell that does not contain an item.

    particular temperature and mixture of gases you need to survive.
    It uses a sophisticated recirculating system and can run pretty
    much indefinitely.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere outside is
    severely toxic (why do the inhabitants of this planet need so much
    nitrogen!?), so you'll have to stay inside for now.

  display:
    attr: device
    char: '±'
  description:
  - |
    A calculator with Advanced Display Technology (an attached
    typewriter that can print out the results).  For some reason, in
    addition to the usual arithmetic on numbers, an ADT calculator can
    also do arithmetic on types!  After all, the helpful typewritten manual
    explains, a type is just a collection of values, and a finite collection
    of values is just a fancy number.  For example, the type `bool` is
    just a fancy version of the number 2, where the two things happen to be
    labelled `false` and `true`.
  - |
    The product of two types is a type of pairs, since, for example,
    if `t` is a type with three elements, then there are 2 * 3 = 6
    different pairs containing a `bool` and a `t`, that is, 6 elements
    of type `bool * t`.  For working with products of types, the ADT
    calculator enables pair syntax `(a, b)` as well as the projection
    functions `fst : a * b -> a` and `snd : a * b -> b`.
  - |
    The sum of two types is a type with two options; for example, a
    value of type `bool + t` is either a `bool` value or a `t` value,
    and there are 2 + 3 = 5 such values.  For working with sums of
    types, the ADT calculator provides the injection functions `inl :
    a -> a + b` and `inr : b -> a + b`, as well as the case analysis
    function `case : (a + b) -> (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> c`.  For
    example, `case (inl 3) (\x. 2*x) (\y. 3*y) == 6`, and `case (inr
    3) (\x. 2*x) (\y. 3*y) == 9`.

  - "This seems like a safe way to execute `grab` only when there is a
    rock to grab.  However, it is actually possible for the `grab` to
    fail, if some other robot B snatches the rock right after robot A sensed
    it and before robot A got around to grabbing it on the next game tick."

    It can be used to locate nearby actors, by bouncing radio
    waves off them and listening for the echo.  This capability can be
    accessed via two commands:
  - |
    `meet : cmd (() + actor)` tries to locate a
    nearby actor (a robot, or... something else?) up to one cell away.
    It returns a reference to the nearest actor, or a unit value if
    none are found.
  - |
    `meetAll : (b -> actor -> cmd b) -> b -> cmd b` runs a command on
    every nearby actor (other than oneself), folding over the results
    to compute a final result of type `b`.  For example, if `x`, `y`,
    and `z` are nearby actors, then `meetAll f b0` is equivalent to
    `b1 <- f b0 x; b2 <- f b1 y; f b2 z`.
