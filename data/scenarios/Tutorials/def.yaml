  Learn how to define new commands.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Your goal is to build a robot to fetch the flower growing in the upper right and bring it back to you; you win the challenge when the base has a flower in its inventory.
      - |
        However, it would be extremely tedious to simply type out all the individual
        `move` and `turn` commands required.  Your base has a `dictionary` device
        that can be used to define new commands.  For example:
      - |
        def m4 : cmd unit = move; move; move; move end
      - defines a new command `m4`, with type `cmd unit`, as four consecutive `move` commands. With judicious use of new definitions, it should be possible to complete this challenge in just a few lines of code.

        TIP: your base is at coordinates (0,0), and the flower is at (16,4), which
        you can confirm by clicking in the world map panel. When you click on a cell,
        its contents and coordinates are shown in the lower left.
      - |
        TIP: the type annotation in a definition is optional.  You could also write
        `def m4 = move; move; move; move end`, and Swarm would infer
        the type of `m4`.

        TIP: writing function definitions at the prompt is annoying.
        You can also put definitions in a `.sw` file and load it
        with the `run` command. Check out

        syntax and error highlighting.

      try {

  def m2 = move; move end;
  def m4 = m2; m2 end;
  def m8 = m4; m4 end;
  def m16 = m8; m8 end;
  def tL = turn left end;
  def tR = turn right end;
  def tB = turn back end;
  def S = m16; tL; m2; tL; m16; tR; m2; tR; m16 end;
  build {
    turn right; S; f <- harvest; tB; S; give base f
  }
