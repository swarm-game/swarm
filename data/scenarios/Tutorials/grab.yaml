  Learn how to interact with the world by grabbing entities.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Previously you learned how to make new things (like a `branch predictor`{=entity}) from ingredients.
        Now you will learn how to obtain the ingredients you need.
      - There are some `tree`{=entity}s ahead of your robot; `move` to each one and `grab` it.
      - You can learn more by reading about the grabber device in your
        inventory.  Remember, if the description does not fit in the
        lower left info box, you can either hit **Enter** to pop out the
        description, or focus the info box in order to scroll.

        return (t >= 6);
      } { return false }
