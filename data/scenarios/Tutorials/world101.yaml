    goal:
      - You're ready to graduate to something a bit more complex! This
        multi-step tutorial will walk you through a few of the first
        steps you might take in exploring the new planet, using many
        of the commands and techniques you have learned in the
        previous tutorial challenges.
      - You can see that your base starts out with some key devices
        equipped and some basic supplies for building robots.  To
        build more advanced devices and produce more robots,
        you'll need to explore, gather resources, and set up some
        automated production pipelines.
      - At this point you may want to create an external `.sw` file
        with useful definitions you create.  You can then load it
        via the `run` command.  See
        https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/tree/main/editors
        for help configuring your editor with support for swarm-lang.
      - Your first task is to collect three or more trees. You can
        remind yourself of the available commands using F4.
    condition: |
      try {
        n <- as base {count "tree"};
        return (n >= 3)
      } { return false }
  - id: get_harvester
    goal:
      - Nice work!  Now, use the trees to make a harvester device.
        This will require several intermediate products; try making
        various things, and take a look at your available recipes (F3)
        and at the recipes listed for items in your inventory.  Of course,
        you may end up needing some additional trees.
    condition: |
      try { as base {has "harvester"} } {return false}
    prerequisite: get_trees
  - goal:
      - Now that you have a harvester, you can use `harvest` instead of `grab`
        whenever you pick up a growing item (check for the word "growing" at the
        top of the item description), to leave behind a seed that will regrow.
      - "TIP: since you only have a single harvester device for now, whenever you
        send out a robot to harvest something, try programming it to come back
        to the base when it is done.  Then, execute `salvage` to get the harvester
        back, so you can reuse it in another robot later."
      - One of the next things you will probably want is a `lambda`, so you can
        define and use parameterized commands.  Scan some things and use
        the process of elimination to find one.  Since lambdas regrow,
        once you find one, try getting it with `harvest`.
      - "TIP: remember that you can click on cells in the world to see their
        coordinates."
