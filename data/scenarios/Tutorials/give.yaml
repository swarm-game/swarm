        Robots can transfer items between them using the `give`
        command. This command takes two arguments: the target
        robot, and the name of the item to give.  The target robot
        is often the special `base` robot, but could be any robot.
      - |
        In this scenario, you will need to collect the items scattered
        around your `base`, by `build`ing one or more robots to collect
        them and then `give` them to you.
      - |
        Start with `build`ing a robot to `grab` the `bit (0)`{=entity} east of the base.
    condition: |
      as base { has "bit (0)" }
  - id: give_rest
    teaser: Fetch the rest
    goal:
      - |
        Good job! Now send robot(s) to grab the rest!
      - |
        But where will you find the item names, so you can `give base "item name"`?
        That's the best part, you won't!
      - |
        You will get the name from the `grab` command result:
        ```
        build { move; w <- grab; turn back; move; give base w }
        ```

        **TIP:** Instead of trial and error, you can get the distance to items
        by clinking on them in the world map, which will show the coordinates.
