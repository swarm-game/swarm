  Learn how to give items to other robots.

  - goal:
      - |
        Robots can transfer items between them using the `give`
        command. This command takes two arguments: the target
        robot, and the name of the item to give.  The target robot
        is often the special `base` robot, but could be any robot.
      - In this scenario, you will need to collect the items scattered
        around your `base`, by `build`ing one or more robots to
        collect them and then `give` them to you.

      return (bd && b0 && lx && co);
