  Learn how to make new things using recipes.
#
# The players should read the recipes and acquaint themselves with the UI.
# This also motivates the next tutorial about obtaining entities.

objectives:
  - goal:
      - Robots can use the `make` command to make things, as long as
        they have a `workbench` and the proper ingredients.  For
        example, `make "circuit"` will make a circuit.
      - Your base has a few trees in its inventory. Select them to see the
        available recipes.
      - Your goal is to make a "branch predictor", so you will have to make
        some "branch"es first.

        Note: when used after opening quotes in the REPL, the Tab key can cycle through
        possible completions of a name. E.g., type:
      - |
        > make "br[Tab][Tab]
    condition: |
      try {
        as base {has "branch predictor"}
      } { return false }
solution: |
  make "branch"; make "branch predictor"
