name: Scan
description: |
  Learn how to send robots to safely scan your surroundings.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - When you land on an alien planet, all the entities in the
        world will be unfamiliar to you, but you can learn what they are using
        the `scan` command, enabled by a `scanner` device.
      - Send one or more robots to move next to some of the unknown entities (marked as ?),
        scan them (with something like `scan forward` or `scan north`), and then return
        to the base and execute `upload base`.
      - For more information about the `scan` and `upload` commands, read
        the description of the `scanner` in your inventory.
