description: |
  Learn how to send robots to safely scan your surroundings.
goal:
  - When you land on an alien planet, all the entities in the
    world will be unfamiliar to you.
  - But you can learn what they are using the scanner device.
  - Send robots to move to the unknown entities (marked as '?'),
    'scan forward' and after that come back and 'upload base'.
  - |
    TIP: You can also 'scan left' or 'scan north', to save on a few
    'turn' commands.

  try {
    bm <- as base {knows "mountain"};
    bt <- as base {knows "tree"};
    bw <- as base {knows "wavy water"};
    return (bm || bt || bw)
  } { return false }

  build {
    turn east; move; move; move;
    turn left; move;
    scan left; scan forward; scan east;
    turn back; move;
    turn west; move; move; move;
    upload base;
