  Learn how to send robots to safely scan your surroundings.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - |
        When you land on an alien planet, all the entities in the world will be unfamiliar to you,
        but you can learn what they are using the `scan` command, enabled by a `scanner`{=entity} device.
      - |
        Send one or more robots to move next to some unknown entity (marked as "?"),
        scan it (with something like `scan forward` or `scan north`), and then return to the base
        and execute `upload base`.
      - |
        For more information about the `scan` and `upload` commands, read the description
        of the `scanner`{=entity} in your inventory. Hit Enter to open the description in a larger window.
