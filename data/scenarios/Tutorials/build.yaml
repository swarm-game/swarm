  Learn how to build robots to carry out simple tasks.
#
# Has to be easy, so that you do not have to debug it too much yet.
#
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Now that you know basic commands, it is time to build robots to do the work for you. You will start in a base ('Ω') that does not move (at least not yet).
      - Let's start by building a gardener robot to perform a simple task.
      - You can `build` a robot with `build {COMMANDS}`{=snippet}, where in place of `COMMANDS`{=snippet} you write the sequence of commands for the robot to execute (separated by semicolons).
      - |
        Build a robot to harvest the `flower`{=entity} and place it next
        to the `water`{=entity}.
      - |
        **TIP:** Newly built robots start out facing the same
        direction as their parent, which in the tutorials will always be north.
    condition: |
      try {
        teleport self (0,-1);
        turn east;
        a <- ishere "flower";
        move;
        b <- ishere "flower";
        move;
        c <- ishere "flower";
        pure (a || b || c);
      } { pure false }
solution: |
  build {turn right; move; move; harvest; turn right; move; place "flower"}
