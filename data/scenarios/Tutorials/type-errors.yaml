  Learn how to discover type errors.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - |
        Let's see what happens when you enter something that does not type check.
        Try typing `turn 1`{=snippet} at the REPL prompt.  Clearly this is nonsense, and
        the expression will be highlighted in red.  To see what the error is, hit **Enter**.
        A box will pop up with a type (or parser) error.
      - "Some other type errors for you to try:"
      - |
        `turn move`{=snippet}
      - |
        `place tree`{=snippet} (without double quotes around `tree`{=snippet})
      - |
        `move move`{=snippet}
      - The last expression might give the most confusing error.
        Obviously we are just missing a `;`{=snippet} separating the two `move`
        commands.  However, without the semicolon, it looks like
        `move` is a function being applied to an argument, but of course
        `move` is not a function.
      - Once you are done experimenting, execute `place "Win"` to finish this challenge and
        move on to the next.

      try {
        w <- as base {has "Win"};
        return (not w);
      } { return false }
