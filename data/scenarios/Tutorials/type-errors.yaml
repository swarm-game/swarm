  Learn how to discover type errors.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - |
        Let's see what happens when you enter something that does not type check.
        Try typing `turn 1`{=snippet} at the REPL prompt.  Clearly this is nonsense, and
        part of the expression will be highlighted in red.  To see what the error is, hit **Enter**.
        The REPL will print out a type error.
      - "Some other type errors for you to try:"
      - |
        `turn move`{=snippet}
      - |
        `place tree`{=snippet} (without double quotes around `tree`{=snippet})
      - |
        `move move`{=snippet}
      - The last expression might give the most confusing error. Obviously we are just missing a `;`{=snippet} separating the two `move` commands.  However, without the semicolon, it looks like `move` is a function being applied to an argument, but of course `move` is not a function.
      - Once you are done experimenting, execute `place "win"` to finish this challenge and move on to the next.

      try {
        w <- as base {has "win"};
        pure (not w);
      } { pure false }
entities:
  - name: win
    display:
      attr: device
      char: 'W'
