  Learn about command return types and how to bind the results.
objectives:
  - id: grab_artifact
    teaser: Retrieve artifact
    goal:
      - |
        A pedestal stands conspicuously empty in the center of the room.
        Perhaps its intended contents lie nearby?
      - |
        Build a robot to retrieve and restore the mystery artifact to its proper place
        in the center of the pedestal!
      - |
        The robot will need to `place "ARTIFACT NAME"`{=snippet}, but you do not know the name yet!
        Fortunatelly, the `grab` command has type `Cmd Text`{=type}, and returns
        the name of the grabbed entity as a text value.
      - |
        To use the result of a command later, you need _bind notation_, which
        consists of a variable name and a leftwards-pointing arrow
        before the command. Like this:
      - |
        `move; art <- grab; place art`
      - |
        **NOTE:** If you find yourself stuck, you can select "Start over" from
        the "Quit" (**Ctrl+Q**) dialog.
    prerequisite:
      not: fail_to_grab
    condition: |
      try {
        teleport self (0,3);
        ishere "Hastur"
      } { pure false }
  - id: fail_to_grab
    teaser: Robor stopped
    hidden: true
    optional: true
    goal:
      - |
        You sent a robot, but it failed to put the artifact in its rightful place.
      - |
        Try again by selecting "Start over" from the "Quit" (**Ctrl+Q**) dialog.
    condition: |
      as base {
        try {
          r <- robotnumbered 1;
          reprogram r {};
          teleport self (0,3);
          h <- ishere "Hastur";
          pure (not h)
        } {
          pure false
        }
      }
