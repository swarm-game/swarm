  Learn about command return types and how to bind the results.

  - goal:
      - |
        A pedestal stands conspicuously empty in the center of the room.
        Perhaps its intended contents lie nearby?
      - |
        Build a robot to retrieve and restore the mystery artifact to its proper place!
      - |
        Note: If you find yourself stuck, you can select "Start over" from
        the "Quit" (CTRL+q) dialog.
    condition: |
      try {
        p <- robotnamed "floorspot";
        w <- as p {ishere "Hastur"};
        return (not w);
      } { return false }

        Your robot obtained the misplaced artifact! Next you need to put it back
        on the pedestal.  But neither you nor your robot knows the
        artifact's name.  How can it be placed?

        Every command returns a value.  However, some simple commands, like
        `move`, do not have any meaningful
        value to return.  Swarm has a special type, `unit`, with only one value,
        called `()`. Since there is only one possible value of type
        `unit`, returning it does not convey any information.
        Thus, the type of `move` is `cmd unit`.
      - |
        Other commands do return a nontrivial value after executing.
        For example, `grab` has type `cmd text`, and returns the name of the
        grabbed entity as a text value.
      - |
        To use the result of a command later, you need "bind notation", which
        consists of a variable name and a leftwards-pointing arrow
        before the command.  For example:
      - |
        move; t <- grab; place t
      - |
        In the above example, the result returned by `grab` is assigned
        to the variable name `t`, which can then be used later.
        This is useful, for example, if you do not care what you
        grabbed and just want to move it to another cell, or if you
        are not sure of the name of the thing being grabbed.
      - |
        Reminder: if you need to start over, your previous commands are
        accessible in the REPL history (up-arrow).
    condition: |
      try {
        p <- robotnamed "pedestal";
        w <- as p {ishere "Hastur"};
        return w;
      } { return false }
