        The 4x4 gray square contains 4 `very small rock`{=entity}s --- so
        small they cannot be seen!  Your goal is to collect all of
        them and bring them back to your base; you win when you have
        all 4.  There is one rock in each row and column, but
        otherwise you can't be sure where they are.  Your best bet is
        to sweep over the entire 4x4 square and pick up a `very small rock`{=entity}
        any time you detect one.

        The `ishere` command, with type `Text -> Cmd Bool`{=type}, can be used
        for detecting the presence of a specific item such as a `very small rock`{=entity}.
        What we need is a way to take the `Bool`{=type} output from `ishere`
        and use it to decide whether to `grab` a rock or not.
        (Trying to execute `grab` in a cell without anything to grab will
        throw an exception, causing the robot to crash.)
      - |
        As you might expect, `if` can be used to write
        conditional expressions.  However, `if` is not special syntax;
        it is simply a built-in function of type
      - |
        ```
        if : Bool -> {a} -> {a} -> a
        ```
      - |
        It takes a boolean expression and then returns either the first or second subsequent
        argument, depending on whether the boolean expression is true or false, respectively.
      - |
        The type variable `a`{=type} can stand for any type; `{a}`{=type}
        indicates a *delayed* expression of type `a`{=type}.  Normally,
        function arguments are evaluated strictly before the function
        is called. Delayed expressions, on the other hand, are not
        evaluated until needed.  In this case, we want to make sure
        that only the correct branch is evaluated.  To write a value
        of type, say, `{Int}`{=type}, we just surround a value of type `Int`{=type}
        in curly braces, like `{3}`.  This is why arguments to `build`
        must also be in curly braces: the type of `build`
        is `{Cmd a} -> Cmd Actor`{=type}.
      - |
        **TIP:** Note that `if` requires a `Bool`{=type}, not a `Cmd Bool`{=type}!  So you cannot directly say
        `if (ishere "very small rock") {...} {...}`{=snippet}.
        Instead you can write `b <- ishere "very small rock"; if b {...} {...}`{=snippet}.
        You might enjoy writing your own function of
        type `Cmd Bool -> {Cmd a} -> {Cmd a} -> Cmd a`{=type} to encapsulate this pattern.
      - |
        **TIP:** the two branches of an `if` must have the same type. In particular,
        `if ... {grab} {}`{=snippet} is not
        allowed, because `{grab}` has type `{Cmd Text}`{=type} whereas `{}`{=snippet} has type `{Cmd Unit}`{=type}.
        In this case `{grab; pure ()}` has the right type.
