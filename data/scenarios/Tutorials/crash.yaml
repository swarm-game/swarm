  Learn how to view built robots and debug them.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Before you send your robots far away from the `base` you need to learn how
        to figure out what went wrong with them if they crash.
      - |
        In this challenge, you should start by
        sending a robot to walk four steps straight east into the mountain,
        crashing deliberately.  However, you must make sure it has a `logger`{=entity},
        so we can see what command failed.  The simplest way to ensure
        that is to have it execute the `log` command; `build` will
        ensure it has the devices it needs to execute its commands.
        For example:
      - |
        ```
        build {log "Hi!"; turn east; move; move; move; log "3"; move; log "OK"}
        ```
      - |
        `wait` for the robot to crash, then execute `view it0`{=snippet} (or whichever
        `itN`{=snippet} variable corresponds to the result of the `build`
        command) to see how far it got. Further instructions should
        appear in the crashed robot's log and `give` you an opportunity to `salvage`
        the situation...

  crasher <- build {
      turn east; move; move; move; log "bye"; move
  };
  wait 32;
  salvager <- build {
      log "I will bring home the Win!";
      turn east; move; move; move; salvage; turn back; move; move; give base "Win"
