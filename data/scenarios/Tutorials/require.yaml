name: Require devices
description: |
  Learn how to require additional devices that would otherwise not be installed.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - The 'build' command automatically installs devices that it knows
        will be required.  For example, if you 'build {move}', some 'treads'
        will automatically be installed on the new robot since it needs
        them to 'move'.
      - However, sometimes you need a device but 'build' can't tell that
        you need it. In this case, you can use the special 'require'
        command to require a particular device.  For example, if you
        'build {require "3D printer"; move}', a 3D printer will be
        installed on the new robot even though it does not execute any
        commands that use a 3D printer.
      - Your goal is to pick a flower on the other side of the river and
        bring it back to your base.  You win when the base has a flower
        in its inventory.
      - "Hint: robots will drown in the water unless they have a 'boat' device
        installed!"
