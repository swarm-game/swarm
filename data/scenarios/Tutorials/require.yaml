  Learn how to require additional devices that would otherwise not be equipped.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - The `build` command automatically equips devices on the newly built robot that it knows will be required.  For example, if you `build {move}`, some `treads`{=entity} will automatically be equipped on the new robot since it needs them to `move`.  (To see what the `build` command will equip, you can type `requirements <e>`{=snippet} where `<e>`{=snippet} is any expression.)
      - However, sometimes you need a device but `build` can't tell that you need it. In this case, you can use the special `require`{=snippet} command to require a particular device.  For example, if you `build {require "3D printer"; move}`, a `3D printer`{=entity} will be equipped on the new robot (in addition to `treads`{=entity}) even though it does not execute any commands that use one.
      - Your goal is to pick a flower on the other side of the river and bring it back to your base.  You win when the base has a `periwinkle`{=entity} flower in its inventory.
      - "Hint: robots will drown in the `water`{=entity} unless they have a `boat`{=entity} device equipped!"
