  Learn how to build a farm to grow and harvest items.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - Lambdas are an essential item for building robots, but they
        are somewhat rare in the wild.  Therefore, it makes sense to farm
        them in order to create a reliable supply.
      - |
        In this scenario, you are a bit farther along: in particular,
        you now have a few `harvester`s, a few `lambda`s, a few `logger`s,
        some `branch predictor`s which
        allow robots to evaluate conditional expressions, and some
        `strange loops` which enable recursive functions.  For example,
        one simple, useful recursive function is
      - |
        def forever = \c. c ; forever c end
      - Your goal is to acquire 256 lambdas.  Of course, in order to
        accomplish this in a reasonable amount of time, it makes sense to plant
        a field of lambdas and then program one or more robots to
        harvest them in an automated way.
      - "TIP: the `ishere` command can be used to test for the presence of a
        (fully-grown) lambda, and the `has` command can be used to test whether
        a robot has a lambda in its inventory."
    condition: |
      try {
        as base {
          n <- count "lambda";
          return (n >= 256)
        }
      } { return false }

  - goal:
      - Congratulations!  You have completed the most difficult simulated exercise and
        are ready to begin exploring the new planet in earnest.  Of course there
        is much more remaining to explore in the world, and many additional programming
        language features to unlock.

        To finally complete this tutorial, there is only one thing left for you to do:
        use one of your lambdas to make some delicious `curry`.
      - Afterwards, you will return to the menu where you can select
        "Classic game" for the complete game experience.  Or, play a
        "Creative game" if you just want to play around with
        programming robots, without any constraints or need to collect
        resources.  You could also choose to redo some tutorial scenarios, or
        explore the other challenge scenarios listed in the menu.
      - Now go forth and build your swarm!
