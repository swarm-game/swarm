  Learn how to equip devices and gain new capabilities.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - You know how to `grab` things lying around, so you are ready to get an upgrade! By equipping devices, you learn new capabilities which allow you to perform more complex commands.
      - Before you start building new robots in the later tutorials, you need to gain the `build` capability. Try typing `build {}` - you should get an error telling you that you need to equip a `3D printer`{=entity}.
      - |
        Fortunately, there is a `3D printer`{=entity} lying nearby.  Go `grab` it, then
        `equip` it with `equip "3D printer"`.

        You win by building your first robot:
      - |
        ```
        build {}
        ```
    condition: |
      try {
        _ <- robotNumbered 1;
        pure true;
      } { pure false }
solution: |
  turn south; move; grab; equip "3D printer"; build {};
