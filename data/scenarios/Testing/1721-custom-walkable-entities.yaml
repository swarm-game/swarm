  The monkey can only walk on `tree`{=entity}s (and `banana`{=entity}s).
  The `path` command must fail until the path of `tree`{=entity}s is completed.

  NOTE: In order for the objectives to be evaluated properly for a "Win", they must be
  ordered strictly with "banana_access" coming before "placed_tree" in the
  list below.
objectives:
  - id: banana_access
    teaser: Banana access
    goal:
      - Give monkey access to `banana`{=entity}
    condition: |
      m <- robotnamed "monkey";
      as m {
        p <- path (inR 10) (inR "banana");
        return $ case p (\_. false) (\_. true);
      };
  - id: placed_tree
    teaser: Tree placed
    prerequisite:
      not: banana_access
    goal:
      - Tree must be placed
    condition: |
      x <- as base {has "tree"};
      return $ not x;
solution: |
  move;

  place "tree"
