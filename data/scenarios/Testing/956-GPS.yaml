  Test the `whereami` command and GPS receiver device.
  https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/956
objectives:
  - condition: |
      loc <- as base {whereami};
      return $ loc == (0,0)
    goal:
      - |
        The goal is to move back to the origin after being
        unceremoniously teleported to a random location.  The only way
        to do this is to use a GPS receiver device to learn the
        current location and use the result to decide how to move.
solution: |
  def x = \n. \c. if (n == 0) {} {c ; x (n-1) c} end;
  def abs = \n. if (n<0) {-n} {n} end;
  wait 2;
  loc <- whereami;
  turn (if (fst loc < 0) {east} {west}); x (abs (fst loc)) move;
  turn (if (snd loc < 0) {north} {south}); x (abs (snd loc)) move;
