        Enables the `path` command:
      - |
        `path : (Unit + Int) -> ((Int * Int) + Text) -> Cmd (Unit + (Dir * Int))`
      - |
        Optionally supply a distance limit as the first argument, and
        supply either a location (`inL`) or an entity (`inR`) as the second argument.
      - |
        Example:
      - |
        `path (inL ()) (inR "tree");`
      - If a path exists, returns the direction to proceed along.
