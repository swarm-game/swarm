# This scenario is specially engineered to almost guarantee a crash
# due to a race condition in short order.
#
#   - The steps per tick is set to 1, so robots are interrupted after
#     every single step, making bugs due to bad interleaving much more
#     probable.
#   - A `weed` entity is used which grows very quickly
#   - `harvest` is used, which causes more weeds to grow in the same spot
#   - A crash happens when the planter robot tests for the presence of a weed
#     and doesn't find one, but then is interrupted and a new weed grows;
#     then the planter robot crashes when it tries to place a weed.
#   - The harvesting robot waits a random number of ticks between 1-4 each
#     time, to give the planting robot time to run into the race condition.
#
# This may work slightly less well once we implement #502, but I think it should
# still work.

  Make sure we can cause a robot to crash due to a race condition, in order to
  know that atomic blocks are doing their job.
