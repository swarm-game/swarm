name: Test issue 397 (wrong device reported missing)
description: |
  A scenario designed to trigger issue 397, where in certain
  situations involving a capability with no candidate devices,
  an incorrect error message was generated reporting some other
  device to be missing.

objectives:
  - condition: |
      t <- time; pure (t == 2)
    goal:
      - |
        This is a dummy condition that just ensures the base has had
        time to run the problematic `build` command.  The scenario
        *should* generate an error message; what we really care about is
        whether the generated error message is correct, which is checked
        in test/integration/Main.hs .
