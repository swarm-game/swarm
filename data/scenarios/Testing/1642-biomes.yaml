  Demonstrate growth restrictions.

  `move`-ing to the distant goal cell gives the
  `wheat`{=entity} enough time to grow back.
objectives:
  - id: harvested
    goal:
      - |
        `harvest` both `wheat`{=entity},
        from west to east.
        Only the eastern wheat should grow back.
    condition: |
      as base {
        c <- count "wheat";
        pure $ c == 2;
      }
  - id: western_wheat_regrew
    optional: true
    goal:
      - |
        Wheat in grass must not regrow
    condition: |
      observer <- robotnamed "observer";
      as observer {
        ishere "wheat";
      }
    prerequisite: harvested
  - goal:
      - |
        Go to the stone patch.
        This takes at least 10 ticks,
        by which time the
        `wheat`{=entity} would have grown back.
        Fails if the western wheat does grow back.
    condition: |
      goalbot <- robotnamed "goalbot";
      baseLoc <- as base {whereami};
      as goalbot {
        goalLoc <- whereami;
        pure $ baseLoc == goalLoc;
      }
    prerequisite:
      logic:
        and:
          - harvested
          - not: western_wheat_regrew
solution: |
  move; harvest;
