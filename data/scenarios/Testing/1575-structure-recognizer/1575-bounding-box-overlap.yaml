name: Structure recognizer - overlapping bounding boxes
description: |
  Recognize non-rectangular structures even when
  bounding boxes overlap with each other,
  or when non-participating entities encroach within
  the candidate bounding box.

  In this scenario, there is only one possible arrangement.
