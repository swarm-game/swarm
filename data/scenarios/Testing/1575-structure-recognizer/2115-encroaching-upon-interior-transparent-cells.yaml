name: Structure recognition - interior transparency
description: |
  Incursion of an entity of a foreign type
  upon a "transparent" cell within the bounding box
  of a recognizable structure shall not prevent
  the structure from being recognized.

  If the incurring entity is the *same* type as
  a participating entity in that structure, however,
  it will prevent recognition.
