name: Structure recognition - piecewise row recognition
description: |
  Demonstrate general solution for transparency.

  In this scenario, a structure called `spaceship`{=structure} is occluded
  by a single cell overlay shape called `damage`{=structure}.

  The base swaps the "damage" entity with the correct part.
