name: Structure recognition - precluding initial overlaps
description: |
  A cell may be a member of at most one structure.

  Since recognition of pre-placed structures bypasses
  the regular "search" process, we need to ensure that
  overlaps are properly excluded by this alternate mechanism.
  In this scenario, only the upper-left structure should be recognized,
  based on the precedence criteria (structure size, then grid location)

objectives:
  - teaser: Recognize exactly one structure
    goal:
      - |
        `square`{=structure} structure should be recognized upon scenario start.
      - |
        Although two of these structures were initially placed, only
        the upper-left one should be recognized.
