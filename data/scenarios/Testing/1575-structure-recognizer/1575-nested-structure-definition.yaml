name: Structure recognizer - nested structure
description: |
  Ensure nested structures are assembled correctly.
  Demonstrate structure recognition both before
  a member is removed and after replacing it.
creative: false
objectives:
  - teaser: Re-recognized
    prerequisite: grab_tree
    goal:
      - |
        Replace `tree`{=entity} after grabbing.
        The `double ring`{=structure} structure should be recognized again.

    goal:

        Pre-placed structure must be recognized
