name: Structure recognizer - nested structure
description: |
  Ensure nested structures are assembled correctly.
  Demonstrate structure recognition both before
  a member is removed and after replacing it.
creative: false
objectives:
  - teaser: Re-recognized
    prerequisite: grab_tree
    goal:
      - |
        Replace `tree`{=entity} after grabbing.
        The `double ring`{=structure} structure should be recognized again.

      foundStructure <- structure "double ring" 0;
      return $ case foundStructure (\_. false) (\_. true);

    id: pre_recognized
    prerequisite:
      not: grab_tree
    goal:
      - |
        Pre-placed structure must be recognized

      foundStructure <- structure "double ring" 0;
      return $ case foundStructure (\_. false) (\_. true);
  - teaser: Grab tree
