name: Structure recognition - rotated structures at same position
description: |
  A map keyed by (position, structure name) would not be sufficient to
  account for multiple orientations of the same structure, sharing the
  same top-left corner position.

  This is why the found structure registry must include orientation
  in its key.

objectives:
  - teaser: Recognize both structures
    goal:
      - |
        Two `thingy`{=structure} structures should be recognized immediately.
        Without distinguishing them by orientation in the registry, only
        one would be recognized.
