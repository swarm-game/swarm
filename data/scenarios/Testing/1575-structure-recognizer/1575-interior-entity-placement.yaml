name: Structure recognition - interior space
description: |
  Entities can be added and removed
  on empty cells within the rectangular
  boundary of an already-placed structure without
  affecting its recognition status.

  Additionally, recognition of statically-placed
  structures at scenario initialization is also
  unaffected by interior entities.

  However, any such "contaminating" entities
  will prevent the recognition of a structure
  when constructed by a robot.
