name: Entity change detection
author: Karl Ostmo
description: |
  Ensure that a change to an entity can be observed
  by a system robot within a single tick.

  In this scenario, the base will first `swap` the
  existing `dial (R)`{=entity} with a `dial (G)`{=entity},
  then immediately `swap` again with a `dial (B)`{=entity}.

  The system robot should be able to detect the presence
  of the `dial (G)`{=entity} before it is `swap`ped a second time.
