name: Requirements of system-robot children
description: |
  Normally, system robots are not required to possess devices in order to use any particular command.
  However, a robot built by a system robot becomes subject to the requirement.
  This is a bug.

  In this scenario, the child robot cannot be built because the
  parent robot ("queenbee") does not possess a "beaglepuss" in its inventory.
