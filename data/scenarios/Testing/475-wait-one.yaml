# The game state validation is performed in integration test,
# here we just set a robot to wait for one tick, during which
# the base wins.

  - condition: |
      try {
        teleport self (0,0);
        ishere "lambda"
      } { pure false }
solution: |
  log "I will win next tick!"; wait 1; place "lambda";
