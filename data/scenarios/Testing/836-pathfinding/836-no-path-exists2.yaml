description: |
  There is infinite area to explore, so
  this will fail to terminate unless
  a limit is set on the max distance.

  In this scenario, we fall back onto the internal distance limit.
  Normally, it would be very expensive to allow this goal condition
  check to run upon every tick. But in this case, we should
  have won the scenario by the first tick.
