objectives:
  - teaser: Apiarist
    goal:
      - |
        Build a `beehive`{=structure}.
      - |
        This will attract bees, which will gather
        `nectar`{=entity} from nearby `wildflower`{=entity}s.
      - |
        Do not crowd hives; provide at least one cell margin
        between them.
      - |
        Given that `wildflower`{=entity}s cannot be relocated,
        judicious placement is essential for efficient
        `honeycomb`{=entity} production.
    condition: |
      foundStructure <- structures "beehive";
      pure $ case foundStructure (\_. false) (\_. true);
  - teaser: Collect honeycomb
    goal:
      - |
        Collect `honeycomb`{=entity} from the `beehive`{=structure}s.
      - |
        After gathering a certain amount of nectar, a bee will return
        to its hive and place honeycomb alongside it.
        A finite amount of honeycomb may be accumulated before the
        bee becomes dormant.
    condition: |
      as base {
        has "honeycomb"
      }
  - teaser: Cooper
    goal:
      - |
        Make a `cask`{=entity}.
      - |
        Use local timber and your on-hand supply of iron material.
      - |
        You may `use "siphon" forward` when positioned in front of
        a lake to fill a `cask`{=entity} with `lakewater`{=entity}.
    condition: |
      as base {
        has "cask"
      }
  - teaser: Brewmeister
    goal:
      - |
        Ferment 2 barrels of `mead`{=entity}.
    condition: |
      as base {
        meadCount <- count "mead";
        pure $ meadCount >= 2;
      }
  - teaser: Tavern keeper
    optional: true
    goal:
      - |
        Construct a `mead hall`{=structure}.
    condition: |
      foundStructure <- structures "mead hall";
      pure $ case foundStructure (\_. false) (\_. true);
