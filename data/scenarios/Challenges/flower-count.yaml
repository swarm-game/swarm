  Count the flowers quickly... or else!

    teaser: Count the flowers!
    goal:
      - |
        Your evil nemesis, the sadistic supervillain Dr. Nemesis, is
        at it again!  They have wired up some explosives to your True
        Love and lit the fuse, but promised to stop it... IF you can
        count all the flowers in time!
      - |
        Specifically, Dr. Nemesis demands that you count the
        total number of flowers in the 120x40 field bounded by walls,
        `print` the number on a piece of `paper`{=entity}, and place
        the paper at the origin, `(0,0)`.  If the number is correct,
        the countdown stops and your True Love is saved.  If the
        number is incorrect... nothing happens, but the fuse continues
        to burn!

        And don't even think about trying to pick any of the flowers.

    goal:

        I told you not to pick any flowers!  Now your True Love is
        dead... because of YOU!

        Perhaps you would like to go back in time and try again.

        You were not fast enough, and now your True Love is
