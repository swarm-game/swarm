  - goal:
      - |
        Several combination-locked gates lie between you
        and treasure.
      - |
        Each "dial" can be one of three colors.
        `drill` a dial to cycle to its next color.
        The adjacent `gate`{=entity} opens when the correct
        combination is set.
      - |
        Unlock all of the combination locks and `grab`
        the `bitcoin`{=entity}.

      as base {has "bitcoin"};
