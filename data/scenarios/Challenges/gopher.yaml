    goal:
      - |
        A gopher (**G**) is defiling your immaculate garden!
      - |
        He will burrow (**o**) underground awhile, then pop up
        anywhere within the rectangular grassy region
        to gloat atop his `mound`{=entity} of dirt for a short time.
        `drill` the `mound`{=entity} while he sits to drive him
        away. Eventually you should wear down his resolve!
