    goal:
      - |
        Arrange the tiles in increasing (row-major) order.
      - |
        To slide a tile into the empty space, position yourself
        behind it and `push`.
      - |
        Or, if you prefer, `drill` a tile to cause it to slide
        into the adjacent empty space. However, you must not drill a tile that
        has nowhere to slide. Also, drilling consumes `ink`{=entity}, which will be replenished
        after the sliding operation is complete, so avoid drilling too fast in
        succession.
