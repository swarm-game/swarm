  - id: get_map
    teaser: Get the map
    goal:
      - As a humble `peat`{=entity} farmer, you subsist in a simple cabin by the `bog`{=entity}. Though long content with this ascetic lifestyle, recently the barren walls have left you restless. Something is missing...
      - "The majestic landscape that is your back yard is insufficient to distract you---not even the ferocious, `lava`{=entity}-spewing volcano little more than a stone's throw from your porch. You are preoccupied by one task: to find the perfect household decoration."
      - First, grab a `map`{=entity} to orient yourself.

      as base {
        has "map";

  - id: find_temple
    teaser: Find the temple
    prerequisite: get_map
    goal:
      - You study the `map`{=entity}.
      - Glacier-bound mountains tower in the `east`, a volcano oozes a river of `lava`{=entity} to the `north`, and beyond that lies a mountain lake, punctuated with islands in the northwest. Iron mines penetrate the base of the volcano. They could be useful, but how will you get there?
      - A `jungle`{=entity} abuts the volcano, ensconcing an ancient ruin. The map notes that bygone travelers have stashed tools among the northeasterly mountains to blaze a path through the jungle.
      - Your only neighbor, a `hemp`{=entity} farmer to the northwest, has evacuated since the sudden volcanic eruption.
      - A disused quarry and clay pit flanks your cabin to the `west`, as does the familiar, swampy `bog`{=entity} to the `east`. A highly-prized `flower`{=entity} is said to grow in the caves beyond the bog.
      - Your mind is made up. You will pillage the ruins for treasure! Head to the ruins and `scan` them. Ingenuity and endurance are your allies as you forge paths through varied obstacles. Study your "recipes" for clues!
