    teaser: Get the map
    goal:
      - As a humble peat farmer, you subsist in a simple cabin by the bog.
        Though long content with this ascetic lifestyle, recently the barren walls have
        left you restless. Something is missing...
      - "The majestic landscape that is your back yard is insufficient to distract you---not
        even the ferocious, lava-spewing volcano little more than a stone's throw from
        your porch.
        You are preoccupied by one task: to find the perfect household decoration."
      - First, grab a map to orient yourself.

  - id: find_temple
    teaser: Find the temple
    prerequisite: get_map
    goal:
      - You study the map.
      - Glacier-bound mountains tower in the east,
        a volcano oozes a river of lava to the north, and beyond that lies a mountain lake, punctuated with islands
        in the northwest.
        Iron mines penetrate the base of the volcano. They could be useful, but how will you get there?
      - A jungle abuts the volcano, ensconcing an ancient ruin.
        The map notes that bygone travelers have stashed tools among the northeasterly mountains to
        blaze a path through the jungle.
      - Your only neighbor, a hemp farmer to the northwest, has evacuated since the sudden volcanic eruption.
      - A disused quarry and clay pit flanks your cabin to the west, as does the familiar, swampy bog to the east.
        A highly-prized flower is said to grow in the caves beyond the bog.
      - Your mind is made up. You will pillage the ruins for treasure! Head to the ruins and "scan" them.
        Ingenuity and endurance are your allies as you forge paths through varied obstacles.
        Study your "recipes" for clues!

        caves, and the treasure of this temple shall be revealed."'
