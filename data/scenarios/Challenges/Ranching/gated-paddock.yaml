    goal:
      - |
        You've homesteaded on a small island in the ocean.
        It's time to gather resources to trade.
      - |
        You encounter some feral sheep (**@**). They slowly wander the island and eat grass.
        Your mind wanders to textiles...
      - |
        First, paddock at least one sheep so they don't drown.
        Make sure there are no gaps in the fence!
      - |
        Note that you can use the `drill` command (by way of the `post puller`{=entity} tool)
        to demolish a `fence`{=entity} that has been `place`d.

        Safe! Your sheep are now hungry.

        The sheep will move toward something edible on
        an adjacent tile and will eat it if they walk over it.
