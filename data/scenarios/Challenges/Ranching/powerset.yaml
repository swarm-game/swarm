    id: complete_powerset
    goal:
      - |
        Farmer Bill is breeding hybrid fruits.
        Each fruit can be paired with one or more other fruit variety, and Bill
        wants to evaluate every such combination.
        He has arranged each hybrid in a column in his orchard.
      - |
        However, his experiment is incomplete! He has forgotten one combination.
      - |
        Place the missing hybrid combination in the empty eastern-most column.
        After you have done this, `place` the "bell" anywhere, and then Bill will inspect
        your work.
