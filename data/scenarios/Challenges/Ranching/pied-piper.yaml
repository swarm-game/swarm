objectives:
  - teaser: Bait
    goal:
      - The village dwellings have been infested by `rat`{=robot}s. You are charged with clearing the infestation.
      - Scurrying feet can be heard through cracks under each `locked door`{=entity}. Unfortunately you've not been entrusted with `key`{=entity}s to the residences.
      - Perhaps there is something that would entice them out? North of the river you spy fields of `oats`{=entity} and a `storage silo`{=structure}.
      - Get some `oats`{=entity}.
    condition: |
      as base {
        has "oats";
      }
  - teaser: Silo
    id: silo
    goal:
      - Inspect the `storage silo`{=structure}.
    condition: |
      as base {
        loc <- locateme;
        return $ fst loc == "silo";
      }
  - teaser: Moldy
    prerequisite: silo
    id: moldy
    goal:
      - A `rat`{=robot} will `selfdestruct` if it comes in contact with `mold`{=entity}.
      - Obtain some `mold spores`{=entity}.
    condition: |
      as base {
        has "mold spores";
      }
  - teaser: Corral
    prerequisite: moldy
    goal:
      - Dispatch the `rat`{=robot}s with `mold`{=entity}.
      - Note that `mold spores`{=entity} will only spread when `sow`n in a dark, damp environment.
    condition: |
      try {
        r <- robotNamed "rat";
        return false;
      } {return true}
  - teaser: Spelunker
    prerequisite: silo
    goal:
      - Find a secret passage.
      - To unlock a door, you need to `use "unlocker"`, which will consume a `key`{=entity}.
    condition: |
      as base {
        loc <- locateme;
