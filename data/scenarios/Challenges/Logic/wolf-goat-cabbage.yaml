        Ferry all three of the `wolf`{=entity}, `goat`{=entity}, and `cabbage`{=entity} across the lake.
        However, only one of these can be carried at a time.

        Furthermore, if left unattended together, the `wolf`{=entity} will eat the `goat`{=entity},
        or the `goat`{=entity} will eat the `cabbage`{=entity}.
