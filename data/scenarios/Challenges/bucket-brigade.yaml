    teaser: Get coal to base
    goal:
      - Deliver a "coal lump" to the base.
      - |
        To excavate coal from the "lignite mine" (M), a robot needs to
        `drill` while in posession of a "bucketwheel excavator".
      - |
        To assemble the excavator, you'll need to repurpose
        some "treads".
        Unfortunately, you have only one set of "treads".
        You'll have to make do...
    condition: |
      as base {has "coal lump"}
  - goal:
      - Your base got some coal!
      - Now fashion more of it into a "coal briquette", and place it
        so that the hauler (=) can pick it up.
      - The hauler will periodically stop at the base
        to check if a load is available.
    condition: |
      hauler <- robotnamed "hauler";
      as hauler {has "coal briquette"}
