objectives:

    teaser: Get coal to base
    goal:
      - Deliver a `coal lump`{=entity} to the base.
      - |
        To excavate coal from the `lignite mine`{=entity} (**M**), a robot needs to
        `drill` while in possession of a `bucketwheel excavator`{=entity}.
      - |
        To assemble the excavator, you'll need to repurpose
        some `treads`{=entity}.
        Unfortunately, you have only one set of `treads`{=entity}.
        You'll have to make do...
    condition: |
      as base {has "coal lump"}
  - goal:
      - Your base got some coal!
      - Now fashion more of it into a "coal briquette", and place it so that the hauler (=) can pick it up.
      - The hauler will periodically stop at the base to check if a load is available.

      hauler <- robotnamed "hauler";
