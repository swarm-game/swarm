description: Make 2048!
objectives:
  - goal:
    - OK, OK, it's not really the same as the classic "2048" game.
      However, your goal is still to make 2048!  You start with a `1`
      which regrows immediately when
      it is harvested, so if you plant it, you can get as many as you want.  Your
      job is to combine `1`s in order to make a `2048`
      entity.
    - "Hint: the `format` command can turn numbers into strings!"
    condition: |
      try {
        as base {has "2048"}
      } { return false }
solution: |
  def makeN : int -> cmd unit = \n.
    if (n == 1)
      {harvest; return ()}
      {makeN (n/2); makeN (n/2); make (format n)}
  end;
  place "1";
  makeN 2048
