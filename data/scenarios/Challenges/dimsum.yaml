description: Serve restaurant patrons with the dim sum cart.
objectives:
  - goal:
      - It is the grand opening of Sigma (Σ), the hot new dim sum restaurant in town. You are the solitary wait staff.
      - It seems that the manager went a bit overboard on furniture; there are dozens of `table`{=entity}s, but hardly any room to walk!
      - Serve the blue patron with a `full cart`{=entity} (f) of food, twice.
      - The `empty cart`{=entity} (e) must be `push`ed to the northwest corner for the cook to load it with food.
    condition: |
      p <- robotnamed "patron";
      as p {
        foodCount <- count "food";
        return $ foodCount >= 2;
      }
