This Wednesday, December 14, we will have the first (annual? monthly?
probably somewhere in between...) Swarm swarm, *i.e.* collaborative virtual
hackathon.  Details can be found [here on the Swarm
wiki](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki/Swarm-swarm).

- Time: [8am-5pm CST / 9am-6pm EST / 2pm-11pm
  UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Swarm+swarm&iso=20221214T14&p1=%3A&ah=9)
  (feel free to drop in and out any time)
- Place: [The Swarm Hive on gather.town](https://app.gather.town/app/SpqG1ic5pNKM7YqS/The%20Swarm%20Hive)
- Who: you! Anyone interested in hacking on Swarm is welcome, from
  experienced to first-time contributors.  If you've been thinking of
  getting involved but haven't yet, this could be a perfect
  opportunity.

As a reminder, [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) is a 2D,
open-world programming and resource gathering game, implemented in
Haskell, with a strongly-typed, functional programming language and a
unique upgrade system. Unlocking language features is tied to
collecting resources, making it an interesting challenge to bootstrap
your way into the use of the full language.
